In the `Employee` class, we define a constructor that takes the `name`, `position`, and `salary` as arguments and assigns them to respective properties of the instance (`this`).

We also define a method called `getSalary` that returns the `salary` property of the instance.

In the example usage, we create an instance of the `Employee` class with the provided values and call the `getSalary` method. The returned salary is logged to the console.

5. Implementing a Person Class with Default Values:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name = "Unknown", age = 0) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  getDetails() {
    return `Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`;
  }
}

// Example usage:
const person1 = new Person("John Doe", 25);
console.log(person1.getDetails()); // Output: Name: John Doe, Age: 25

const person2 = new Person();
console.log(person2.getDetails()); // Output: Name: Unknown, Age: 0
